# Passive IUU Detection Device

## Fishackathon 2018 - NYC

## Team Happy Fish

### Heroku Deployment:

https://happy-fish.herokuapp.com/

### Challenge Statement:

Protecting restricted fishing zones (e.g. marine reserves, remote areas) from illegal fishing is a huge challenge. A passive tool (maybe using sonar?) that helps identify fishing activity in restricted areas would help agencies monitor, track, and enforce laws more effectively.
